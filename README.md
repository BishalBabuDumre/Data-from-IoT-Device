# Data-from-IoT-Device
This repository provides codes named from 0runAll.py to 13UploadBox.py along with JSON files and ConfigurationFile.csv file. The first code 0runAll.py can be called from Automator app as a Calendar alarm in MacOS, or a similar method in other OS to automate this whole code base everyday at a certain time. 0runAll.py has description of each code from 1KeithleyDownload.py to 13UploadBox.py as comment that helps to understand what each code does.
This repository can help someone who is trying to write codes to extract data from any IoT device, processes it, and send the graphical and video results as an email everyday. Specifically, this code is written to automate the email sending process for solar panels testing. This code helps to ease the installation and uninstallation of solar panels by simply updating name of the panel and other necessary parameters in ConfigurationFile.csv file. Email can be sent to specific email addresses of relevant company clients.
Without going deep into the coding, one can modify the JSON files in order to control the total amount and nature of graphical and video analysis.
